<h2>Goal</h2>

End project would represent Bob the astronaute in a space station. A bioorganisme has mutated and corrupted part of the station. He has to fight it in order to survive. To do this, he can teleport to other ships. While on expedition, he can fight using weapons, collect ressources, craft using inventory or station. Sometimes, it is necessary to use small ships (like the mantis) to travel or fight. Using crafted tools, Bob can repair a lot of things.
